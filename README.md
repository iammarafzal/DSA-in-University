# DSA-in-University  
This repository contains all **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practices and projects implemented in **C++** during university coursework.  

## 📂 Folder Structure  
Each practice or project is organized into a separate folder:  
- 📁 **Linked Lists** – Implementation of singly, doubly, and circular linked lists.  
- 📁 **Stacks & Queues** – Stack and queue operations using arrays & linked lists.  
- 📁 **Sorting & Searching** – Algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Binary Search, etc.  
- 📁 **Trees & Graphs** – Implementations of BST, AVL Trees, Graph Traversal (DFS, BFS).  
- 📁 **Dynamic Programming & Recursion** – Solving problems with DP and recursive techniques.  

## 🚀 Getting Started
