# DSA-in-C++
This repository contains all **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practices and projects implemented in **C++** during university coursework.

## 📂 Folder Structure  
Each topic is organized into a separate folder for clarity and easy navigation:  

- 📁 **Array List** – Dynamic array implementation with resizing, insertion, deletion, search, and sorting functions.  
- 📁 **Circular Queue** – Circular queue operations using arrays or linked lists.  
- 📁 **Graph by Linked List** – Graph representation using adjacency list and its traversal (DFS, BFS).  
- 📁 **Hash** – Hash tables with various collision resolution techniques.  
- 📁 **Linked List** – Singly, doubly, circular, and two-way linked list implementations.  
- 📁 **Queue by Array** – Basic queue operations using arrays.  
- 📁 **Queue Linked List** – Queue implementation using linked list.  
- 📁 **Priority Queue** – Standard priority queue implementation.  
- 📁 **Priority Min Heap** – Priority queue using min-heap logic.  
- 📁 **Priority Max Heap** – Priority queue using max-heap logic.  
- 📁 **Max Heap** – Max heap operations like insert and delete max.  
- 📁 **Min Heap** – Min heap operations like insert and delete min.  
- 📁 **Stack** – Stack implementation using arrays and linked lists.  
- 📁 **Tree Array** – Tree (binary) representation and operations using arrays.  
- 📁 **Tree by Linked List** – Tree representation and traversal using pointers.  
- 📁 **Two Way Linked List** – Doubly linked list supporting bi-directional traversal.  
- 📁 **Applications** – Real-world use cases and implementations of:  
  - Stack (e.g., expression evaluation, conversion, reversing string)  
  - Heap


- 📁 **Projects** – Mini DSA projects combining multiple data structures.
  - Flight System
  - Library Management System
  - Student Management Systen
